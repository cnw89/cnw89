- 👋 Hi, I’m @cnw89
- 👀 I’m interested in a couple of different projects:
-- 1) Some simple educational models about home heating and energy use with a heat pump vs gas boiler
-- 2) Some simple educational models illustrating a 'systems' approach to various environmental processes contributing to global warming 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning streamlit python library.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on forming an open source heat pump database.
- 📫 How to reach me ... on here somehow?
